# Riot API Site

## Description
A frontend website that pulls information from the RIOT League of Legends API. Used as a method to improve my skills in using
third party API's. This site is built using the ReactJS framework with typescript.

### Current Progress
Basic web layout finished. Riot required CORS so I built a small backend API using GO and Gorilla mux and handlers to fetch data.
Pages currently don't do much, need to setup reducer to properly load information.

### TODO
- Use proxy to connect to backend API
- Add fetching to get images from ddragon api
- Do more CSS
- Most of the website is not done, just the basic bones/structure
